# What is Nyctodetect
This is a college project and collaberation with [@ZackAkil](https://github.com/ZackAkil) from [@Google](https://github.com/google) in helps to improve Artifical Intelligence models
in the platform [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/)

# What is this project for?

This project allows us to collect data for Nyctophobia. In our survey, we ask users to rate how they feel in a scale system of 1 - 5 based on the images we present. We then present the image (of similar nature) to an AI imaging model which will learn how to detect scenes or images that may associate to Nyctophobia.
